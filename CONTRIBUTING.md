# Contributing

## General Workflow

[Github Flow][GitHub Flow] is the model that this project uses for managing the repo. Below is a general set of steps to follow.

1. Fork the repo
1. Cut a descriptively named feature branch from master
  - oauth-authentication
  - video-resizing
  - server-tests
1. Make commits to your feature branch. Try to be as descriptive as possible.
  - Adjusted size of editor div
  - Added error checking to library
  - Created tests for export featue
1. When you've finished with your fix or feature, Rebase upstream changes into your branch. Submit a pull request
   directly to master. Include a description of your changes.
1. Your pull request will be reviewed by another maintainer. The point of code
   reviews is to help keep the codebase clean and of high quality and, equally
   as important, to help you grow as a programmer. If your code reviewer
   requests you make a change you don't understand, ask them why.
1. Fix any issues raised by your code reviwer, and push your fixes as a single
   new commit.
1. Once the pull request has been reviewed, it will be merged by another member of the team. Do not merge your own commits.
