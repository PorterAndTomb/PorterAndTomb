{"name":"PorterAndTomb","tagline":"3D virtual world for collaborative programming","body":"### Welcome to PorterAndTomb.\r\nPorterAndTomb is a 3-dimensional virtual world built for collaborative programming. We are trying to create an environment/experience that is similar to physically pair programming with other developers. Think of it like a virtual office. You can move around and look at what other people are working on, call someone over to help you, or you can just write code in a unique environment! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Ready to take the red pill?\r\nCheck out the latest version of PorterAndTomb here: http://videofeature.azurewebsites.net/\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCassandra Cruz (@alicekamada)\r\nPhoebe Li (@schoenflies)\r\nBenjamin Zarzycki (@kf6nux)\r\nEvan Hackett (@evanhackett)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFeel free to reach out to any member of our team.\r\ncelkamada@gmail.com\r\nphoebe.li66@gmail.com\r\nBenjamin.Zarzycki@gmail.com\r\nevanwhackett@gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
